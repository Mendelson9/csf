Homework 3 

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:

GC-content: 0.3

Problem 3:

Commenting out seq gives an error in the next for loop where seq is not defined in line 45
Commenting out linenum led to an error in line 40 about not beingg defined.
Commenting out gc_count leads to it not being defined like the other examples

Problem 4:

GC-content: 0.3
AT-contnet: 0.7

Problem 5:

G count 1
C count 2
A count 5
T count 2

Problem 6:

the sum of A, T, G, C are different than the total count for all files exempt the test-small. The sum answer is less than the others because it does not take in account the scan search

Problem 7:

AT/GC Ratio: 2.33333333333

Problem 8:

nicks-air:HW3 Nick$ python dna_analysis.py data/test-small.fastq
GC-content: 0.3
AT-contnet: 0.7
G count: 1
C count: 2
A count: 5
T count: 2
Sum count: 10
Total count: 10
Seq length: 10
AT/GC Ratio: 2.33333333333
low GC content
